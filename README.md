# no-touching

This program was made as a fun way for me to create a new project and learn new libraries while solving a problem I have.
Oftentimes, I find myself unconsciously touching my face, and then the next day I'll have a bit of irritation from clogged pores.
This program allows me to use my webcam to track these instances when I touch my face and play an mp4 file of my choosing to alert me!
